# terraform-google-fullstory-cloud-relay

The relay project provides a service that relays HTTP requests (including WebSockets) to a different service. The most common use is to relay requests from a hostname in one domain to a service in a different domain.

For example, you could run an instance of Relay at design-tool.your-domain.com and configured it to relay requests to a third party service like design-tool.com.
